## Introduction

"REDUX is not madatory"
Do we actually need REDUX, IT must be thought out process to use REDUX
Only when data is heavily used we make use of REDUX (Read and write operations/lot of components where data is being transfered)

REDUX and REACT are different Libraries
REDUX is a sepearate library which we install in our application
